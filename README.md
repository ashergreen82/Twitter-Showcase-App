## **Summary**

<pre>
This is my very first time programming in two languages!!  The last project wast he Star Wars API where everything was done on the front end.  This project gave me the opportunity to program the front end and the back end.

What I larned from this project was how the backend and frontend work together to make the app work.  Many programs in todays world have separated the two in order to make upgrading and manageing the sysstem much easier.
