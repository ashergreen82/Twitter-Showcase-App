## **Summary**

<pre>
This is my very first time programming in two languages!!  The last project was the Star Wars API
where everything was done on the front end.  This project gave me the opportunity to program the
front end and the back end.

What I learned from this project was how the backend and frontend work together to make the app
work.  Many programs in todayâ€™s world have separated the two in order to make upgrading and managing
the system much easier.

This program was also my continued practice in working with APIs,  APIs as you know are very
important in working on the web as the web is the glue that holds are world together.  It is through
the web that we can remove fear and promote peace in our world.
